<br/>

- Develop a WebApi based on a DDD Pattern in .Net6

- Develop a Angular CRUD Application to maintain the data with validation in front and backend ( use FluentValidation Syntax in Both)

- The Angular Application also should have a overview with an grid

- The Application should be startable with a docker-compose and checkable

<br/>

### Requirements to run the project

#

- [Node 19.0.0](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)

- If you want to run the project using docker, you need to install [Docker](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop)

### How to run

#### Optionals Configurations

<br>

- You can change the connection string in the following file if you want to use another database:

```json

// Go to the backend folder

cd backend

// Go to the BookAuthorCRUD folder

cd BookAuthorCRUD

 // Open the appsettings.json file and change the following line:

"ConnectionStrings": {
    "DefaultConnection": "YOUR_CONNECTION_STRING"
  }

```

- If you want to use another connection string, using the docker-compose.yml file, change the following environment variables:

```bash

# CONNECTION STRING

- ASPNETCORE_CONNECTIONSTRING = YOUR_CONNECTION_STRING

# OR INMEMORY DATABASE

- ASPNETCORE_USEINMEMORYDATABASE = true


```
